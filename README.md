# MINST-Digit-Recognition
Digit Recognition using 2 layer convolutional Neural Network on Keras - Tensorflow

### Overview:

Resulting accuracy on 5th epoch:
Training Accuracy: 98.20%
Test accuracy: 99.04%
Train on 60000 samples, validation on 10000 samples

### Future Updates: 

Parameter tuning needed. filter sizes need to change, code can be optimized for computation. Soon I will upload a new code, with better amalgam of networks and parameters.
